Today was Race Day.

I did not realize that the girl scouts have a Pinewood Derby Competition. I realize it, now. Most of the participants are genuinely happy to see their cars roll down the track. Some were disappointed with the results. It is a wholesome fun environment and a greate experience for these kids.

A search of "How to make a Pinewood Derby Car Fast" yields some results: 
1. Dr. Action with Ball Aerospace created an entire [site dedicated to pinewood derby tricks](https://pinewoodphysics.com/index.html).
2. Mark Rober made a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RjJtO51ykY) on how to increase the chances of winning by using some techniques to even the playing field.

You do not have to have a phd like Dr. Action, or a former Nasa engineer like Mark Rober to gather information from the internet and learn from them. The baseline assumption going into competitions like this is that all other contestants are aware of all of the tricks as well. Why wouldn't they be? In 10 minutes of watching a video you get 7 tips to improving your cars performance. In 45 minutes of building a pinewood derby car, almost anyone with a little bit of DIY can compete at the top of the game. From this point - it is up to chance, or very subtle details that may improve performance from one car to another. At the very least, it makes rolling them down the track a more exciting spectator sport.

Except, for some reason, this is not the baseline. Those who are curious and have assumptions that someone has figured this thing out before find information on how to have a chance in the competition and make things close. Some could hide or conventiently not share the learned tricks that are freely available to all to get ahead of the competition, but it may feel a little bit like cheating. At the very least, total domination feels a little bit hollow. Those "knowers" were certain to (and did) dominate those who did not know. It is not even close.

We must train on how to compete with one another. Not for the sake of beating each other, but for the sake of raising the productivity of all of them. Yes, this is just a pinewood competition for girls between the ages of 7-13, but this is also an opportunity to introduce a way of thinking that honors the knowledge of those humans who have come before us. It applies to agriculture, engineering, coding, ship building, welding, pipe fitting and every other aspect of society and human ingenuity. We must train to use the entirety of the brain, the human collective brain and the very best of the tools available to maximize human acheivement. We must learn to network with one another and share this knowledge so that people do not get crushed by competition, and so confidence builds in the ability to compete. If you still lose, at least they used every resource and every bit of advantage they could possibly squeeze out. After using all of the known techniques, if someone finds a new way to dominate the competition consistently? That's true advancement. For the individual and for the whole and for everyone after them.

These are the 7 Key Steps to competing in Pinewood Derby:
1.  Center of Mass slightly in front of rear axle
2.  Reduce Wind Resistance
3.  Run on 3 wheels
4.  Light-weight wheels
5.  Nail prep, polish and bending
6.  Railride/alignment
7.  Graphite

Happy Racing!
