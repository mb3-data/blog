title: "The Robust Data Supply Chain"

My studies in school were in supply chain. I have spent almost 20 years working at manufacturing companies engineering robust "self healing" supply chains. 

What's our demand forecast? How many expensive widgets do we need to buy? Where should we place which widgets throughout the world? Should we repair these widgets or hold them? Fill rate driven or system availability driven? What is the probability risk of stock out? Given our delivery schedules of these parts, which one is most likely to be the highest problem? Should we upgrade parts to stay spared for a specific configuration or not?

The problems were on a large scale. It's exciting work. Many thousands of widgets. Many hundreds of suppliers. Many dollar implications. Many people to contribute.

I am very comfortable answering these questions because of the tech toolset I have acquired.

I have relied on Python heavily. Pandas was/is my friend for smashing together small and large datasets and accessing databases across organizations. You name the database architecture, I have dealt with extracting data from it. ERP systems, engineering systems, catalogs, many, many data lakes and data marts.

I have programmed data pipelines, stored data, managed databases, cleaned data, written models, run models, analyzed models, interpreted models, written simulations, done causal based forecasting, time series forecasting, regression analyses, visualized data and generally communicated detailed products of large scale enterprise level data for a long time. I am a fish in a data lake of supply chain data. 

I have crashed anaytics platforms that couldnt handle the volume of data. Python has had an answer to all of it.

I have typically worked in teams of 3-7 people.
In all of these instances, we always aimed for robust solutions that could withstand disruption and minimized the need for IT organizations to get involved. We needed to move quickly to answer questions. We measured for it. Ran what-if scenarios, simulations, and prepared to be ready.

Supply chains are complex systems in a complex world. Sometimes we add complexity with monolithic processes and procedures and software packages. We add expensive tools to perform low-code, self-service "analytics". We split work into smaller chunks in the process and have a "data team", a "sql team" and an "analytics team" maybe a business analyst to document requirements. Let's add in a ticketing system as well to capture all the work. some of it hits the mark. Some just isn't the level of detail we need.

I have seen it. Sometimes it is not what I would call robust. I can accomplish everything above with Python, some SQL, and some focus time. An agile board like Trello is great to document and coordinate. Keep it nimble. PowerBI is great for people who need quick low code solutions. I just need more in my visuals. I need Python, matplotlib, pandas.

I've used Access, Excel, vba, Qlik, Tableau, PowerBI, Microstrategy, PowerQuery, DAX, PowerAutomate... Nothing can hit all the notes like Python, good version control, and a good text editor, when it comes to data. Add in an orchestration tool like Luigi, Airflow, or Dagster and I can really cook beginning to end. Add in Pytorch for some serious cuda ML work. Want to host your model output on a website? Python Dash, Flask, Django. want to walk someone through a technical concept? Jupyter Notebooks.

I've had people tell me to use other visual data transformation tools because Python is too slow to develop in. I just know these tools well enough to fly. AI coding companions can help to speed developement, too. The benefits of solid version control and flexibility offered is just too good to pass up, especially in small teams which need to move fast. In larger teams, I still don't know how those benefits are not super valuable. Maybe if you were onboarding new analysts to handle the common query and general report building request? I don't know...

You want to talk about a robust supply chain? Python has the data supply chain covered. And Python can move easily within an organization within any current architecture with very little, if any, IT support.

In a currently shifting world it is advantageous to minimize high monthly rates paid to large analytics packages... Python is it for most things analysis in Supply Chain and Operations. I promise I can answer just about any question with it. Everyone should learn, just a little bit.
